# Vectify

## Project Structure Overview

This repository contains the following main folders:

### **Backend/**

Contains the Python backend code, including model files, image processing scripts, and output directories. Handles server-side logic, AI model inference, and file management for image vectorization and enhancement.

### **Mobile/**

Holds the Flutter mobile application code and related resources. This is the client-side app for interacting with the backend and displaying results on mobile devices.

### **Notebooks/**

Contains Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, model training, and research. Useful for documenting experiments, visualizations, and iterative development of machine learning models.

### **Experiments/**

Includes experimental projects and prototypes, such as Rust-based vectorization tools and optimization scripts. Used for testing new algorithms and approaches before integration into the main application.

## About Vectify

Vectify is an image vectorization and enhancement application that converts raster images to scalable vector graphics (SVG) format while providing image upscaling and enhancement capabilities.
